Verdi with it's subcommands enables a variety of operations such as inspecting the status of ongoing or terminated calculations, showing the details of calculations, computers, codes, or data structures, access the input and the output of a calculation, etc. Similar to the bash shell, verdi command support Tab completion. Try right now to type verdi in a terminal of the aiida container and tap Tab twice to have a list of subcommands. Whenever you need the explanation of a command type verdi help or add -h flag if you are using any of the verdi subcommands. Finally, fields enclosed in angular brackets, such as `<pk>`, are placeholders to be replaced by the actual value of that field (an integer, a string, etc...)"
